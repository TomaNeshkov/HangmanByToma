 ["Hangman"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) is an old, very popular game that almost everybody knows about. You start off with a number of blank spaces, which you have to fill-in using a variety of characters, from A to Z - you must guess the word, avoiding pitfalls, or the hangman will die and you'll lose!

# Input:
* You have to input a letter from <kbd>A</kbd> to <kbd>Z</kbd>.
* Then, you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

# Output:
- The program reads your input and determines wether or not the letter is contained in the randomly chosen word. If it is, you will see the blank spaces get updated with your inputed symbols. If not, you will see the hangman slowly appear.
- If you lose, you are greeted with a custom losing animation, and shortly after a death screen which shows you the word that you couldn't guess. After that you can determine if you want to play again, or not.
- If you win, you are greeted with a winning screen, in which you are given the options to play again or quit.
