 ["Hangman"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) is an old, very popular game that almost everybody knows about. You start off with a number of blank spaces, which you have to fill-in using a variety of characters, from A to Z - you must guess the word, avoiding pitfalls, or the hangman will die and you'll lose!

# Input:
* You have to input a letter from <kbd>A</kbd> to <kbd>Z</kbd>.
* Then, you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

# <span style="color:#FF5733; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">Output:</span>
- <span style="color:#3498DB; font-weight: bold;">The program reads your input and determines whether or not the letter is contained in the randomly chosen word.</span> If it is, you will see the blank spaces get updated with your inputted symbols. If not, <span style="color:#E74C3C; font-style: italic;">you will see the hangman slowly appear.</span>
- If you <span style="color:#E74C3C; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">lose</span>, you are greeted with a custom losing animation, and shortly after a death screen which shows you the word that you couldn't guess. After that you can determine if you want to <span style="color:#FF5733; font-weight: bold;">play again</span>, or not.
- If you <span style="color:#27AE60; font-weight: bold;">win</span>, you are greeted with a winning screen, in which you are given the options to <span style="color:#FF5733; font-weight: bold;">play again</span> or <span style="color:#E74C3C; font-weight: bold;">quit.</span>
