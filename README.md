 ["Hangman"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) is an old, very popular game that almost everybody knows about. You start off with a number of blank spaces, which you have to fill-in using a variety of characters, from A to Z - you must guess the word, avoiding pitfalls, or the hangman will die and you'll lose!

# Input:
* You have to input a letter from <ins>'a'</ins> to <ins>'z'</ins>
